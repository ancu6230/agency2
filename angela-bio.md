Angela holds a PhD in Geography from the University of Colorado â€“ Boulder and an MSc-R in Geographic Information Sciences and Society from the University of Edinburgh. Her substantive interests include critical military geographies and patterns of neighbourhood change. She is fascinated by questions of scale, uncertainty, emergence, and the co-constitutive relationship of places and individual life-courses. A spatial analyst and historical geographer, her methodologies employ big historical microdata, statistical analysis and visualization, and archival research at the intersection of the humanities and social sciences. As part of DHARPA, she collaborates in the construction of software modules and workflows, and frets over the project website.
